1. Login using a pre determined username and pins
2. Transfer money to other users
3. Request for a loan from the bank
4. Calculating and returning total deposits, withdrawals and interest
5. Show transactions in a chronological order
6. Sort the transactions on the basis of amount
7. Internationalizing dates and times
8. Internationalizing currencies.
9. Auto logout after a continuous period of inactivity.
